We need to implement all theses "methods" or "algorithm"
## Min conflicts
We start with an initial assignment to the variable (random ?)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-conflicts_algorithm
## Simple backtracking
No initial assignment (just like lecture Tuesday 21 January )
## Backtracking with forward checking
No initial assignment just like Simple backtracking but with heuristic (just like lecture Tuesday 21 January )
## Backtracking with constraint propagation (MAC)
??
## Local search using a genetic algorithm with a penalty function and tournament selection
Just like in this french video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DMibr0J0c4&t=0s

It's not that hard if you understand evolution by random mutation and natural selection.
